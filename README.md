10 Ansible Playbooks to Streamline Linux User Management

As a DevOps enthusiast, I’ve been diving deep into Ansible to automate system administration tasks. Recently, I developed and tested 10 Ansible playbooks to manage Linux users and groups efficiently. These playbooks cover everything from creating users to managing SSH keys and bulk user creation from CSV files. I’m excited to share my work with the community!

What’s Included?

Here’s a quick overview of the playbooks, all tested and verified on Linux hosts using an host.ini inventory file:





Create a New User: Set up a user with a specific UID, home directory, and shell.



Delete a User: Remove a user and their home directory.



Add User to Sudoers: Grant passwordless sudo access.



Manage User Passwords: Update passwords for multiple users securely.



Create a Group: Create a group with a specific GID and add users.



Remove a Group: Delete a group after clearing user assignments.



Set SSH Keys: Add SSH public keys for passwordless login.



Lock/Unlock User Accounts: Lock or unlock accounts as needed.



Manage User Attributes: Update shell, comment, or account expiry.



Bulk User Creation: Create multiple users from a CSV file.

Why Ansible?

Ansible’s simplicity and idempotency make it a go-to tool for automating repetitive tasks like user management. These playbooks are designed to be reusable, secure, and easy to adapt for your environment.

Code and Details

I’ve shared the full code for all 10 playbooks, along with the host.ini inventory file and supporting files (e.g., CSV for bulk user creation). You can find everything in my GitHub repository: [Insert GitHub URL here]. Each playbook is documented and ready to run with minimal setup.

To get started:





Clone the repository.



Update host.ini with your host details.



Run the playbooks with ansible-playbook -i host.ini playbooks/<playbook>.yml.

Key Takeaways





Automation Saves Time: These playbooks reduce manual user management tasks to a single command.



Security First: Passwords are hashed, and sudoers files are validated with visudo.



Scalability: The bulk user creation playbook handles large user lists effortlessly.
